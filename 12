Modern Open Standards
 
An identity authentication, authorization or storage system must be based on modern open standards wherever possible
 
Identity and access management systems are complex.  They contain a multitude of specialist actors, protocols, transfer, 
storage and exchange mechanisms that should not be built from the ground up wherever necessary.
 
The same criteria for building encryption and hashing systems should also be extended to identity and access management infrastructures.  
The protocols designed for the registration, authentication and authorization of identity data are mature, well designed, 
documented and supported.
 
Examples of some identity standards that are applicable in this space include (but is not limited to):
 
OAuth2 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
OpenID Connect - http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html
User Managed Access - https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/rec-uma-core.html
Open Authentication (OATH) - https://openauthentication.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ReferenceArchitectureVersion2.pdf
JSON Web Tokens - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519
JSON Web Signatures - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515
JSON Web Encryption - http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7516
HMAC OTP - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226
Time-based OTP - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226
