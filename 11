A Right (or not) to be Forgotton
 
Description:

Before an identity is created, transparency surrounding a right (or not) to be forgotten must be made to the identity data owner
 
Not all services will provide a right to be forgotton.  Before an identity profile is created within a target system, there must 
be a full and transparent exchange of terms and conditions, regarding the service provider's stance with respect to the right to be

This should include, but be not limited to, items such as what data will be kept and removed, the time taken to remove any data, 
the type and form of any data that will be kept and for how long.
