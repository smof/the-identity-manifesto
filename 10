Transparent Implicit Sharing
 
Implicit sharing of identity attribute data, must be transparent to the data owner  - If A shares to B, B can't share to C without 
transparency to A.
 
Identity data is vast, sprawling multiple containers, personas, custodians and consumers.  Data sharing becomes a complex and 
often opaque array of interactions.
 
Sharing mechanisms for identity data must contain transparency and consent as their core values.
 
If user A shares identity information to service provider B, service provider B, must provide transparency if they intend to 
share that data again and also gain approval via a consent framework.  Identity data must not become orphaned within a system - 
that is stored but has no explicit approval for being there.
