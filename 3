A digital identity will have static and dynamic relationships to other identities, things, services and data, that should be 
defined by clear interfaces, modularity and cohesion
 
A modern identity and access management system, should make provision for leveraging relationship data between different entities. 
The term "graph relationships" could be used for this purpose, where the relationship meta-data is separate from the entities 
themselves, providing a more modular and scaleable data set.  The "social graph" could be an example of this.

Treating relationships as "first class citizens" free's the identity object from having to manage and host all of the 
multi-directional links that will exist between the various different actors in the service landscape. Data traversal 
becomes more dynamic and each component more modular and less tightly coupled, making updates and replacements to the 
interactions simpler.
 
The three main identity actors here are users, devices and API's. All separately maintained and provisioned.  
The relationship links - based on adjectives - are simply consumes, owns and shares.  A user will share data with another user.  
A user will consume data from an API. A user will own a device.  Each relationship can be an object in their own right, 
with provisioning and deprovisioning functions.  Each relationship is likely to also have other meta data such as time 
stamping, ownership and expiration.
