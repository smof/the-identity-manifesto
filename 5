An identity authentication or authorization system must operate consistently for different users, devices and contexts
 
For every request made into an authentication or authorization, not only must the method of processing a request be 
consistent for the same user, the method of processing must be consistent for different users, devices or contexts 
that expect a response from the service.
 
For example, if a system requires a username and password to authenticate a user, every request must require that 
data - the result can of course by different.
 
This will provide a contract between the calling service and the authentication or authorization service.
