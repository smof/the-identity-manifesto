The "Coincidence of Wants"

There should always be an economic "coincidence of wants" with respect to the providing of identity attribute data to a 
service provider, API or application.
 
A coincidence of wants often refers to non-monetary trade - where the supplier of good or service A wants good B, 
and the supplier of good or service B wants A.  An exchange without currency.
 
When it comes to the exchange of identity data, whether implicit or explicit, there is often no monetary reward on 
immediate exchange.  If a service asks for an email address, date of birth or postal address, there has to be an 
immediate and well known benefit or exchange of service to the contributor.  This can help provide an understanding 
to the identity owner with respect to the benefit received, the risk involved and how to evalutate the request for data.
